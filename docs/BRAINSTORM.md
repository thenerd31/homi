# üí≠ Brainstorming & Ideas

## Core Concept Evolution

### Initial Problem
Airbnb in 2008 was revolutionary, but it's built on pre-AI paradigms:
- Manual filtering (dropdowns, checkboxes)
- Text-based searching
- Static photos
- Manual listing creation
- No personalization

### Our Vision: VIBE
**"What if Airbnb were founded in 2025?"**

---

## Key Features

### 1. üó£Ô∏è Conversational Search
**Instead of**: Clicking 15 filters
**We do**: "Find me a beachfront villa in Malibu under $300/night with a hot tub for next weekend"

**Tech Stack**:
- Vapi for voice input
- Groq for fast filter extraction
- Letta for remembering preferences ("You usually like modern designs...")
- Elastic for semantic vector search

**User Flow**:
```
User speaks/types ‚Üí
Groq extracts filters in <1s ‚Üí
Letta adds context ("They liked pools before") ‚Üí
Elastic finds semantically similar listings ‚Üí
Claude re-ranks by relevance ‚Üí
Show top 20 in Tinder UI
```

---

### 2. üëÜ Tinder-Style Discovery
**Instead of**: Scrolling through 100 listings
**We do**: AI curates 20 perfect matches, swipe to choose

**Why This Works**:
- Paradox of choice: fewer options = faster decisions
- Engagement: swiping is fun and addictive
- Learning: we learn preferences from swipes
- Mobile-first: designed for phones

**Swipe Actions**:
- ‚ùå Left = Pass
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Right = Like (added to favorites)
- ‚≠ê Up = Super Like (instant booking intent)
- üí¨ Tap = Ask questions

---

### 3. ü•Ω AR Property Preview (Snap Spectacles)
**Instead of**: Imagining what a place looks like
**We do**: See it overlaid in your actual space

**Use Cases**:
1. **At home**: Point Spectacles at your room ‚Üí see how the Airbnb compares in size/style
2. **At destination**: Walking around a neighborhood ‚Üí see listings overlaid on buildings
3. **Virtual staging**: See empty rooms furnished

**Tech**:
- Snap Lens Studio
- Snap ML object detection
- Claude Vision for generating AR layouts
- Real-time data from our API

**AR Overlay Shows**:
- Listing title floating in 3D
- Price tag
- Amenity icons (WiFi, pool, etc.) positioned where they actually are
- Room dimensions
- "Book Now" button

---

### 4. ü§ñ Auto-Optimize Listings (Host Side)
**Instead of**: Hosts spending 2 hours writing listings
**We do**: Upload photos ‚Üí AI does everything

**AI Pipeline**:
```
Host uploads 10 photos ‚Üí

Step 1: Claude Vision analyzes each photo
  - Detects: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, pool, etc.
  - Identifies amenities: WiFi router, coffee maker, BBQ
  - Assesses quality/style

Step 2: Fetch.ai Pricing Agent
  - Analyzes competitive listings in area
  - Suggests optimal price
  - Provides price range

Step 3: Groq generates content
  - Compelling title
  - Engaging description
  - Highlights best features

Step 4: Fetch.ai Q&A Agent
  - Generates 15 common Q&A pairs
  - Available for instant guest queries

Step 5: Save & Publish
  - Indexed in Elastic for semantic search
  - Available for booking
```

**Value Prop**: 2 hours ‚Üí 2 minutes

---

### 5. üí¨ Per-Listing AI Assistant
**Instead of**: Waiting for host to respond
**We do**: Instant answers via Fetch.ai agent

**Examples**:
- Guest: "Is this place pet-friendly?"
- Agent: "Yes! The host welcomes dogs under 25 lbs. There's a fenced backyard perfect for your pup."

- Guest: "How far from the beach?"
- Agent: "Just a 3-minute walk (0.2 miles) to a private beach access. You can see the ocean from the balcony!"

**Tech**:
- Fetch.ai Q&A Agent (registered on Agentverse)
- Claude as reasoning engine
- Toolhouse for tool access (web search, maps, etc.)
- Chat protocol enabled for discoverability

---

### 6. üé• AI-Powered Virtual Tours (LiveKit)
**Instead of**: Static photos
**We do**: Live video tours with AI guide

**Two Modes**:

**A) Human Host Tour**
- Guest requests tour
- LiveKit creates video room
- Host gives live walkthrough
- Guest can ask questions in real-time

**B) AI Tour Guide** ü§ñ (Most Complex LiveKit Prize)
- No human needed
- AI agent with voice (TTS)
- Connected to camera feed
- Describes what it "sees" using Claude Vision
- Answers questions during tour
- Available 24/7

**Example AI Tour**:
```
AI: "Welcome! Let me show you around. We're starting in the living room.
     Notice the floor-to-ceiling windows with an ocean view. The modern
     sectional sofa seats 6 comfortably. To your left, you'll see..."

Guest: "Is that a fireplace?"

AI: "Yes! It's a gas fireplace, very easy to use. Perfect for cozy evenings.
     It's included in your stay. Would you like to see the bedroom next?"
```

## Advanced Ideas (If Time)

### 8. üé≠ "Vibe Check" Viral AI (Fetch.ai Personal AI)
A sarcastic, funny AI that roasts your choices

**Personality**:
- Gen Z energy
- Brutally honest
- Viral-worthy responses
- Helps you find your "vibe"

**Examples**:
```
User: "Find me the cheapest place in Manhattan"
Vibe Check: "Bestie, the cheapest place in Manhattan is New Jersey üíÄ
             But fr, here's a cozy spot in Washington Heights for $120/night"

User: "I want a luxury villa for $50/night"
Vibe Check: "And I want a pet unicorn ü¶Ñ Let's be realistic, luv.
             How about $200/night for something actually nice?"

User: *swipes right on expensive place*
Vibe Check: "Ooh big spender! üí∏ Your credit card is shaking rn"
```

**Why This Wins Viral Track**:
- Shareable on TikTok/X
- Unique personality
- People will interact just for laughs
- Drives engagement

---

### 9. üîÆ Predictive Booking
Letta learns your patterns:
- "You usually book beach places in summer"
- "You prefer check-in after 4pm"
- "You always ask about parking"

Proactively suggests bookings:
- "Your anniversary is next month! Want me to find a romantic cabin?"

---

### 10. üåç AR Neighborhood Explorer
Put on Spectacles, walk around a city:
- See available listings overlaid on buildings
- Ratings float above properties
- Price tags visible from street
- Tap in AR to book

## Technical Innovations

### 1. Hybrid Vector + Filter Search
```
User: "Modern beach house under $300"

Process:
1. Extract filters: price_max=300, location="beach"
2. Generate embedding: [modern, contemporary, sleek, minimalist...]
3. Elastic query:
   - Must match: price <= 300, location contains "beach"
   - Semantic match: vector similarity to "modern" aesthetic
4. Return top semantically similar within filter bounds
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination
```
User searches ‚Üí
  Search Agent coordinates:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Pricing Agent: "What's budget-appropriate?"
    ‚îú‚îÄ Q&A Agent: "Pre-generate FAQs"
    ‚îî‚îÄ Vibe Check AI: "Roast their choice" üòÇ
  ‚Üí Returns comprehensive result
```

### 3. Real-Time Learning Loop
```
User swipes ‚Üí
  Letta updates preferences ‚Üí
    Future searches weighted by past likes ‚Üí
      Better recommendations ‚Üí
        Higher conversion
```
