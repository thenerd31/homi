## 💡 Talking Points

### Why This Matters
"The travel industry is stuck in 2008. We have ChatGPT, Midjourney, self-driving cars - but we're still clicking through 50 filter checkboxes to find a place to stay. Homi brings the home-sharing experience into the AI era."

### Technical Achievement
"We built a production-grade platform in 48 hours that integrates 7 different AI services, processes real-time video, handles natural conversations, and generates entire listings from a phone camera scan. This isn't a prototype - it's architecture you could deploy tomorrow."

### Real-World Impact
"Hosts spend 1-2 hours creating a listing. With Homi, it's 2 minutes. That's not a nice-to-have, that's a 97% time savings that directly impacts host acquisition costs and platform growth."

### What We Learned
"Building truly AI-native applications isn't about adding a chatbot - it's about reimagining the entire user experience around what AI can do. Every pixel of Homi was designed for the AI era."
